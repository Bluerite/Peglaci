  "description" : "A race of peaceful, peace-keeping humanoids from an icy world. A race mod created originaly by Djinn, revived by the community.\n\n[h1]ORIGINS:[/h1]\n\n[i]\"Other races may seek for ages the mystery of their origins. Not so for the Peglaci - we alone know our creators.\"\n\n\"In our distant past, the Peglaci were an apex carnivore, hunting - and being hunted by - the whales that were their chief source of food. They scarcely had tool-use, and gathered themselves in hunting bands, raiding other groups and running off with their young.\"\n\n\"One day, a great light came upon our ancestors, and they felt themselves change inside - the influence of the Giants, our creators and parents to us all. Over scant millenia, the Giants guided our species from savagery into civilization, spurning our worship and instilling in us the knowledge that we could be as them, one day.\"\n\n\"The Giants answered what questions we thought to ask, seemingly proud that we sought to push ourselves forwards, and ever willing to help us advance. They asked nothing of us in return - what could we give a race such as theirs? Even so, we strove to live up to their intentions for us, however murky they may have seemed.\"\n\n\"All at once, they left us. Whether they ascended beyond this realm, having accomplished their goals, or merely died off, we know not. All they left us were their artifacts, their databanks, and their belief in tolerance and justice.\"\n\n\"As Peacekeepers, we strive to make the galaxy a better place for all beings, as they would have wanted.\"[/i] \n\n- Cicatrice White-Glare, Peacekeeper Chief\n\n[h1]FEATURES:[/h1]\nThe Peglaci are a brand new race ideally suited for cold climates - no longer will you fear the cold, now you will embrace it. \n\n[list][*][b]Brand New Ship[/b] - tiny, but terribly efficient. All tech in the ship is concentrated in one area near the captain's chair. The rest of the ship keeps growing with each tier.\n[*][b]Armor For Every Tier[/b] - Armor for every tier of content to keep you warm and comfortable no matter how cold it gets!\n[*][b]Weapons For Every Tier[/b] - Balanced spears, axes, fist weapons, and throwing weapons for every tier!\n[*][b]Guns with Alternate Fire [/b]- You start with a small pistol; you'll find that you can either fire it as normal or charge it to fire a bouncing shot. There are a lot of balanced and fun guns that you can craft and, later on, enhance. All of the with their unique alt ability.\n[*][b]Fine Dining [/b]- The Peglaci come with two new crops, that can also be found (rarely) in the wild: Snowberries and Spongeweed.\n[list][*]Snowberries are sweet, and terribly poisonous - but have interesting medicinal properties...\n[*]Spongeweed carries the ability to hyperoxygenate the blood - one bite restores a large amount of air, but with processing it can be made into an elixir that allows extended periods without air!\n[*]Additionally, a Peglaci on a frozen planet can always feed themselves, even without a campfire! Frostbitten Meat can be made with a bit of Meat and snow to restore some hunger and a bit of health, and Slushpaste can be made in even leaner situations - with some plant fibre and a bit of snow, a Peglaci can make a concoction that will suppress hunger for a while (although it tastes utterly foul).[/list]\n[*][b]Integration with Vanilla Resources [/b]- This is a BIGGIE. The Peglaci have an opinion for [strike]almost[/strike] EVERY VANILLA OBJECT IN THE ENTIRE GAME! No matter whether you're in a Glitch town, a Human prison or an Avian tomb, your character will have something to say about it!\n[*][b]You Don't Start as a Total Failure[/b] - Often overlooked as a feature! You start out with a set of Tier 1 armor, a dagger and a broken (easily repairable) gun. You were sent out to do a job, so you're not starting from scratch!\n[/list]\n\n[h1]COMMUNITY UPDATED:[/h1]\nThis mod is revived for the community, to the community. That means that everyone can help! Lore, Art, Scripts, Buildings, Ideas, etc.\n\nCheck our Discord server to stay in touch:\nhttps://discord.gg/QxDVQjt\n\nIf you're looking for the last dev release check here:\nhttps://github.com/Unknown-Anomaly/Peglaci\n\nSome of the positions that you can fill if you want to help us:[list]\n[*][b]Programmer[/b] If you know LUA, JSON and how Starbound interact with its files, you can do a lot of things.\n[*][b]Pixel Artist[/b] Because without new assets, the amount of things we can do are limited.\n[*][b]Concept Artist [/b]Designin new assets, effects, weapons, abilities, etc. It's a lot easier with a visual reference. Even lore writing could benefit from it!\n[*][b]Lore Maker [/b]The amount of lore left by Djinn it's limited. To expand in missions and history, we will need some lore as a context, and as codex entries.\n[*][b]Map Maker [/b]Missions, encounters, dungeons, microdungeons, villages. We need people that can build cool things... and if the can learn how to use Tiled, is even better!\n[*][b]Mision Designer [/b]Building a cool structure is one thing, but create a coherent, good looking and balanced mission, it's another. Know how to use Tiled is not a must, but is a very good plus.\n[*][b]Beta Tester [/b]Because someone has to test the crazy things. =P\nAnd much more! You don't need to fill one particular rol or be very involved to help. Any small suggestion or bug report it's really helpfull, even just talk about the mod with others about the mod.[/list]\n",
