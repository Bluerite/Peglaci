# Dialogs
These are the responses of different NPC (tenants, villagers, guards, etc.) when the player interact with them. In this document, you can write or edit the responses of Peglaci NPCs to any player, and the responses of NPCs from different races, to a Peglaci player. You can see examples of those, in the folder "dialog" of the assets of the game.
